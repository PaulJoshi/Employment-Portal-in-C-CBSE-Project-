# Grade-XII-Project-Hireco
This is our class XII CBSE Board Project. An employment portal where a user can create a profile and resumes can be searched with filters

Hey guys,
This is my first coding project. I made this at high school. Its an application for an employment agency that enables their customers to post their resumes and employers to search through them easily, thus providing a fast and efficient platform for employment. This project involves collection of information, constrained and organized display of the same and restricted access to modify. The various processes involved in this program are insertion, modification, deletion, access verification, presentation, and search.

**The main menu consists of the following functions which enables the user to perform the corresponding tasks:-**
1.	Post your resume.
2.	Search Jobs
3.	Login to update resume
4.	Display all resumes
5.	About us
